<!--Description-->
<h2> Description </h2>
  <!--Describe the project (what is a pomodoro timer?)-->
  <p> The Pomodoro Technique is a way to manage focus time for better performance (at least for me). The user has to choose a task to focus on for a set period of timer, and once 
      that time has finished, then the user can take a small break or a long break depending on how my sessions the user has done.</p>
